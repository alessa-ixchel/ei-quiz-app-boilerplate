This quiz project was completed in 3 days with Alessa as my partner. The goal of the project was to create a quiz that functioned with absolutely no html elements. Instead, we were to use jquery functions to meet the requirements of the assignment. 

Features include:
-Only show one section at a time
-Include A11y functionality
-Tell the user when they are correct
-Tell user when incorrect and the answer
-Always have question number and score displayed
-Include a final results page
